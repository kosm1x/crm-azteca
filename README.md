# Agentic CRM

An agentic CRM for media ad sales teams. AI agents that do the CRM work for your sales team.

## How It Works

Salespeople chat with AI agents via WhatsApp. Each person gets a personal CRM assistant that:

- **Logs interactions** — After every client call, the AE tells their agent what happened. The agent logs it, updates deal stages, and flags follow-ups.
- **Tracks quotas** — Agents know each AE's weekly quota and proactively surface pipeline gaps.
- **Manages email** — Search inbox, read messages, draft replies — all through the chat.
- **Handles scheduling** — Creates calendar events, sets follow-up reminders, delivers morning briefings.
- **Searches documents** — RAG pipeline with sqlite-vec indexes Google Drive files for semantic vector search (Dashscope text-embedding-v3, 1024d), scoped by hierarchy.
- **Escalates risks** — When quota is critically low, negative patterns emerge, or mega-deals stall, the agent escalates up the chain (AE → Manager → Director → VP).
- **Serves dashboards** — On-demand web dashboards per role with hierarchical quota views, pipeline funnels, at-risk deals, and alerts. Links delivered via WhatsApp with short-code URLs.

## Architecture

The system mirrors the org chart:

```
VP of Sales
├── Director (Region A)
│   ├── Manager (Team 1)
│   │   ├── AE 1  ←→  Personal WhatsApp group + AI agent
│   │   ├── AE 2  ←→  Personal WhatsApp group + AI agent
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Manager (Team 2)
│   │   └── ...
│   └── Manager Team Group  ←→  AI agent (coaching, rollups)
├── Director (Region B)
│   └── ...
├── Director Team Group  ←→  AI agent (strategic insights)
└── VP Team Group  ←→  AI agent (chief of staff)
```

For a team of 50 salespeople, this creates ~68 WhatsApp groups, each with an isolated AI agent that has role-appropriate access to CRM data.

### Message Flow

```
WhatsApp → engine (NanoClaw) → Direct tools (31 CRM tools via inference adapter)
                                    ├── Role-based tool filtering
                                    ├── Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Calendar)
                                    ├── RAG search (sqlite-vec KNN + text-embedding-v3)
                                    ├── Web search (Brave API)
                                    └── CRM CLAUDE.md (persona + schema + rules)
```

### Data Model

17 SQLite tables: `persona`, `cuenta`, `contacto`, `contrato`, `descarga`, `propuesta`, `actividad`, `cuota`, `inventario`, `alerta_log`, `email_log`, `evento_calendario`, `crm_events`, `crm_documents`, `crm_embeddings`, `crm_vec_embeddings` (sqlite-vec virtual table for KNN search).

### Tools by Role

| Role | Tools | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| AE | 29 | Log activities, manage deals, send emails, set reminders, search docs, web search, analytics, cross-sell |
| Manager | 22 | Team pipeline, quota rollups, coaching briefings, email, docs, web search, analytics, cross-sell, swarm analysis |
| Director | 21 | Analytics, event tracking, email, docs, web search, win/loss trends, cross-sell, swarm analysis |
| VP | 20 | Executive dashboards, org-wide visibility, docs, web search, analytics, cross-sell, swarm analysis |

31 unique tools total across activity logging, pipeline management, Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Calendar), event tracking, document search (RAG with sqlite-vec), web search, historical analytics, cross-sell recommendations, parallel swarm analysis, and follow-up reminders.

### Proactive Workflows

Scheduled tasks run automatically, staggered by role to prevent thundering herd:

| Workflow | Schedule | Roles |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Morning briefing | Weekdays (VP 8:45, Dir 8:52, Mgr 9:00, AE 9:10) | All |
| Weekly summary | Friday 4pm | AE |
| Follow-up reminders | Hourly 9-6 weekdays | AE |
| Alert evaluation | Every 2 hours | All (6 evaluators + event countdown) |
| Document sync | Daily 3am | All (Google Drive → RAG index) |

### Escalation Cascade

Real-time escalation triggered on every activity insertion:

```
AE quota < 50%           → Manager notified
3+ negative sentiments   → Manager coaching signal
Entire team < 70% quota  → Director pattern alert
3+ stalled mega-deals    → VP systemic risk warning
```

## Engine

This project is powered by [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw), an open-source platform for building AI agent systems on WhatsApp. NanoClaw handles the messaging infrastructure, container isolation, and agent orchestration. The CRM layer adds sales-specific schema, tools, personas, and hierarchy management on top.

The engine lives at `engine/` as a git subtree. See [docs/UPSTREAM-SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM-SYNC.md) for how to pull updates.
